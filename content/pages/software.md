I'm a designer by trade but started to learn development in 2020 and I'm currently developing in [Python](#python), [ExtendScript for Adobe](#extendscript), and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I'm sharing some of my projects here in hope that you may find them useful.

### Word Search Generator ([GitHub](https://github.com/joshbduncan/word-search-generator){: target="_blank" })

Word-Search-Generator is a Python module for generating fun [Word Search Puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search).

Like most of my programming endeavors, Word-Search-Generator was born out of necessity. I needed an easy way to generate a bunch of word search puzzles for kid's food menus.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Does the world need this? Probably not.  
‚è∞ Did I spend way too much time on it? Yep!  
‚úÖ Does it come in handy? Heck yeah!  
üëç Did I have fun making it? Absofreakinglutly!

## Adobe Scripts (ExtendScript) {: #extendscript }

As a longtime user of Adobe products I often find the need for extended functionality. Here are some of the solutions I have developed.

### Ai Command Palette ([GitHub](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette){: target="_blank" })

Boost your Adobe Illustrator efficiency with quick access to **most Menu Commands** and **Tools**, all of your **Actions**, **Bookmarked** file or folder, and any **Scripts** right from your keyboard.

And, with custom **Workflows**, you can combine multiple commands, actions, and scripts to get things done in your own way. Replace repetitive tasks with workflows and boost your productivity.

### Ai Match Objects ([GitHub](https://github.com/joshbduncan/adobe-scripts#matchobjectsjsx){: target="_blank" })

Match one or more objects to another by position, size, rotation, layer, and or alignment.

**My most used script by far!**
